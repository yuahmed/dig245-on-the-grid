## Design

Follow the prompt in Chapter 4 of Critical Web Design to create a responsive grid-based design. 

1. Start with the desktop layout first. 
1. Use a [layout grid for each device size](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows) in Figma. See also [Everything you need to know about layout grids in Figma](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids/) by Thomas Lowry
1. Use any grid-based site as inspiration. 
1. Add any text and images you like; for example [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) or [alternatives](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/awesome-lorem-ipsum-alternatives/)
1. After you have completed multiple versions of the desktop, complete the tablet and mobile layouts. 


## Code

Code your design in HTML/CSS/JS using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework. Test your breakpoints often by adjusting the width of the browser window.



## Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, push, publish, and post all deliverables to Moodle per documentation in the Assignments.
